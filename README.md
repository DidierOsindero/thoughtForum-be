## <b>Description✍🏾</b>

### <b>💭What is it?</b>

A blogging app where users can write blog posts and share them. Users can sign-in using Google and decide if they want their posts to be made public or private. If a post is public, all other users on the site will be able to view it while the private setting limits viewing access to the author of the post, allowing users to keep a private collection of posts.

### <b>💭What will it be?</b>

The ultimate vision is that users will be able share and discuss their ideas on topics to do with art, thought/philosophy and science on a beautifully designed website that inspires creative thinking. I am currently working on adding the ability to comment on blog posts which will enable users engage with blog posts. Similarly, I am hoping to implement a like feature which will allow users to like posts by other users and view their liked posts on their profile page.

### <b>💭What have I learnt?</b>

Through this project I learned about user authentication with Firebase, the useContext, useCallback and useRef React hooks, as well as some helpful models for structuring files in a React App. I also learnt to use React Router to simulate a multi-page application with dynamic URLs.
